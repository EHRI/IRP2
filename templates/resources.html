              of documents created or received by the U.S. Government during and after World War II as part of its investigations
              into cultural assets that were looted or otherwise lost during the war. All of the records have been described

            <div class="general">
              <p class="brief">As the Nazis took over Europe in WWII, they looted everything from major artwork pieces from national museums
                to ceremonial and personal items from the Jewish people. The Ardelia Hall is a record collection of these
                recovered items and the work to restore these stolen items to their proper owners. This is one of the most
                popular collections at the National Archives and provides a different picture of the Holocaust that many
                may not know about.

            German descriptions and digitized images available on <a href="https://invenio.bundesarchiv.de/basys2-invenio/direktlink/47f30320-f947-4edd-8049-f3fb8b010675/">Bundesarchiv web site.</a>
            <p>The U.S. Army collected files of Alfred Rosenberg from various sources for use at the Nuremberg trials. These
              records were subsequently taken to Alexandria, Virginia, USA, and were partly microfilmed. These files, which
              were known as the U.S. Army Departmental Records Branch Record Group 1008, Reich Ministry for the Occupied
              Eastern Territories, arrived at the Bundesarchiv in March 1963 in the course of the repatriation of records
              from the USA. In the fall of 1963 the records were split into several groups according to their provenance.
              Those files that were part of this repatriation and originated from the Rosenberg Chancellery represent the
              main body of Record Group NS 8 (Kanzlei Rosenberg). Some files that had made their way to the State Archives
              of Nuremberg and were handed over to the Bundesarchiv in 1955 were also added to this Record Group, as were
              several volumes from various other American records repatriations. Further additions included one volume from
              the Central Archives of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, Zentrales Staatsarchiv der DDR - 62 Ka 2/1) and
              one volume from the so-called NS-archives of the Ministry of State Security of the GDR (NS-Archiv des Ministeriums
              für Staatssicherheit der DDR - ZA VI 6322).

            <p>Record Group NS 30 (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg) comprises a collection of dispersed files and single
              documents received from various sources. Most of these records derive from the provisional office of the ERR
              in Ratibor, Silesia. Part of the ERR headquarters (Stabsführung) and staff of the Ostbücherei (a special ERR
              library responsible for research on Bolshevism) were evacuated from Berlin to Ratibor, beginning in 1943, together
              with large holdings of books. The ERR in Ratibor later received additional documents that the members of the
              Hauptarbeitsgruppen (HAG) Ostland, Ukraine and Weißruthenien (Main Working Groups in the Eastern Territories,
              Ukraine, and White Ruthenia) had been able to rescue. The records stored at Ratibor were later evacuated to

            <p>The British records available through this portal are held by The National Archives in London, the repository
              since Domesday of all British government documentation. They represent records from all government departments
              involved in countering the Nazi spoliation of Europe and in resolving restitution and reparation claims arising
              after the war.
            </p>
            <p>The records highlight the wartime policy initiatives taken by the British government including the Inter-Allied
              Declaration against Acts of Dispossession Committed in Territories under Enemy Occupation and Control, issued
              in London on 5 January 1943, and the establishment of the Vaucher Commission in April 1944 and the Macmillan
              Committee in May 1944. Both during and after the war, the UK committed efforts and resources to establish collecting
              points and restitution commissions in Europe and effected the return of looted property to countries across
              Europe.
            </p>
            <p>Documents range from policy proposals to forms submitted by claimants seeking post-war restitution, as well as
              photographs of missing works of art and lists of individuals involved in the looting and damaging of cultural
              property. One of the distinctive features of this collection is the focus on losses from both public and private

              <h2>Archives on the Spoliations committed in France during the Second World War (English)</h2>
              <p><strong>The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs participates fully in the activities of the public authorities regarding the restitution and compensation of cultural property looted during the Second World War by the Germany occupation authorities.</strong>                It contributes in particular to research into the origin of works of art, both for the public and for its
                institutional partners: the National Museums section of the Ministry of Culture and Communication; and the
                Commission d'indemnisation des victimes de spoliations (Commission for the Compensation of Victims of Spoliation
                -- CIVS), which reports to the Prime Minister.
              </p>
              <p>In order to carry out this work successfully, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs relies on a considerable archives
                collection, which is curated by the Diplomatic Archives Directorate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
                taken responsibility for the archives of the Service des biens et intérêt privés (Department for Personal
                Property and Interests) (OBIP), which have been supplemented with those records created by Rose Valland during
                her work in France and Germany after the war, as well as by the archives of other French services tasked
                with locating and returning looted cultural property (Commission de Récupération artistique (Commission for
                Art Recovery), Office des biens et intérêt privés (Office for Personal Property and Interests), Bureau central
                de Restitutions (Central Office for Restitutions), Service de Récupération artistique de Berlin (Berlin Department
                for Art Recovery) and Service de Remise en place des œuvres d'art (Department for the Return of Works of
                Art). Most of the documents illustrating Rose Valland's heroic activity at the Jeu de Paume during the Occupation
                are to be found in the Bibliothèque et les Archives des Musées nationaux (Library and Archives of the National
                Museums) in the Louvre.
              </p>
              <p><strong>All of these archives are accessible to researchers</strong> (to victims' families as well as to notaries
                and lawyers, historians, museum curators and art trade professionals). They can be consulted at the headquarters
                of the Diplomatic Archives Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, situated to the north of Paris
                (3, rue Suzanne Masson -- 93126 LA COURNEUVE) <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/ministere_817/archives-patrimoine_3512/index.html">or online</a>.
                Because of the lack of a single, reliable inventory, as a first step, the curator responsible for the collection
                carries out research for information that is sought whether by French or foreign researchers.
              </p>
              <p>These precious archives are fragile and of interest to a very wide audience. In 2011, in order to facilitate
                both their consultation and their preservation, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs tasked a specialist
                in archiving and digitization of documents (the Van Dijk company) to carry out a feasibility study for the
                digitization and indexing of the whole archive collection.
              </p>
              <p>As a first step, the Diplomatic Archives Directorate has undertaken the following tasks:
                <ul>
                  <li>Creation of a single searchable database. Created using Cadic software, it contains more than 50,000 records
                    describing the content of files and providing an index of the names of owners, artists and works. The
                    database is in a test and verification phase, but is available to French and foreign institutional partners
                    who so request.
                  </li>
                  <li>Digitization of photographs, classified by owner, available in the Reading Room.</li>
                  <li>Digitization, indexing and uploading (in 2014) of photographs of the Goering collection.</li>
                  <li>Digitization and uploading (in 2014) of German lists (particularly from the ERR) of looted property.</li>

              </p>
              <p>Pour mener à bien cette action, le ministère des affaires étrangères s'appuie sur un fonds considérable d'archives
                que conserve la direction des Archives diplomatiques. Chargé des attributions du Service des biens et intérêt
                privés, le ministère des affaires étrangères en conserve en effet les archives auxquelles se sont ajoutées
                celles créées par Rose Valland dans le cadre de son activité en Allemagne et en France après la guerre, ainsi
                que les archives d'autres services français chargés de retrouver et de restituer les biens culturels spoliés
                (commission de Récupération artistique, office des Biens et Intérêts privés, bureau central des Restitutions,
                service de Récupération artistique de Berlin, service de Remise en place des œuvres d'art). La majeure partie
                des documents illustrant son activité héroïque au Jeu de Paume pendant l'Occupation est en revanche conservée
                par la Bibliothèque et les Archives des Musées nationaux situées au Louvre.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Toutes ces archives sont communicables.</strong> Mises à la disposition de tous les chercheurs (les

              <p>Ces archives précieuses sont fragiles et intéressent un très large public. Pour faciliter leur consultation
                et, en même temps, les préserver, le ministère français des affaires étrangères a chargé en 2011 un spécialiste
                dans l'archivage et la dématérialisation des documents (la société Van Dijk) de réaliser une étude de faisabilité

            <p>On 16 November 1944, shortly after the liberation of the Belgian national territory, the Belgian authorities
              set up the Department for Economic Recovery (DER)/Office de Récupération Economique (ORE) under the former
              Ministry of Economic Affairs. From its creation until its dissolution in 1968, the DER was the sole Belgian
              office responsible for tracing, recovering and liquidating lost movable goods of Belgian private or public
              possession in Belgium or abroad during the Second World War. As such, the DER was assigned with the tracing
              of enemy military equipment and responsible for war reparations by means of industrial compensations in kind,
              as well as the recovery and restitution of Belgian properties, including cultural goods. In light of the latter
              task, the DER included a culture office that was commissioned to identify and restitute stolen works of art.
              This resulted in the creation of various interesting record series on stolen artworks, including declaration
              forms, various files, file cards and a collection of photographs and glass negatives. The State Archives in
              Belgium conserve the "General Files" of the post-World War II service for the recovery of artworks, which was
              part of the DER. These records, which can be found under inventory numbers 362-632, are primarily in French
              and/or Dutch, and include a few records in English.</p>
            <p>The documents on the registration and recovery of looted art, which constitute a specific section within the
              "General Files," were digitized in 2012. The digital images have been linked to the existing inventory descriptions,
              which are currently available on the State Archives' intranet. Researchers are required to inform the personnel
              of the National Archives (the State Archives' repository in the Brussels region) in advance and direct their
              inquiries before an appointment in the reading room can be made. <a href="http://arch.arch.be/%7Btaal%7D/component/option,com_rab_instellingen/task,view/id,1/Itemid,176/">
				Instructions for making such arrangements can be found online</a>. Apart from its General Files, the DER also opened
              files about individual recovery claims that were handled. These files form a distinct archival fond of 120
              linear metres, comprising two series dating from the 1940s to the early 1960s. The files concerning individual
              recovery claims from the DER have also been inventoried (this search instrument has been incorporated in the
              sub-series "National Archives of Belgium," as inventory I 400). The inventory is not accessible online yet,
              but even so, all research for individual names must be performed via the former institute's alphabetical file
              card system (sorted according to the family names of all persons who made claims). Such preliminary research
              must be performed by the personnel working at the National Archives of Belgium 2 ("Cuvelier repository"). In
              practice, <a href="http://arch.arch.be/%7Btaal%7D/component/option,com_rab_instellingen/task,view/id,996/Itemid,176/">requests
					for information are to be directed here</a>.</p>
            <p>Because of the fact that all DER files about persons who also filed a claim at the Office for War Damage (Administration
              Dommages de Guerre) were transferred to the latter administration, the very voluminous archives from the Office
              for War Damage (under the authority of the former Minister for Reconstruction, later Public Works) will undoubtedly
              contain more information on looted or lost artworks. Handling of the reparation claims for material damage
              incurred to private goods led to the creation of a huge file series, 10 kilometres of which has been conserved.
              Access to the file series of the Office for War Damage requires navigating through a complex record card system.
              Since the archives consist of a central series as well as nine provincial series, one can perform a double

            <p>The Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), the "Special Task Force" headed by Adolf Hitler's leading ideologue
              Alfred Rosenberg, was one of the main Nazi agencies engaged in the plunder of cultural valuables in Nazi-occupied
              countries during the Second World War. A particularly notorious operation by the ERR was the plunder of art
              from French Jewish and a number of Belgian Jewish collections from 1940 to 1944 that were brought to the Jeu
              de Paume building in the Tuileries Gardens in Paris for processing by the ERR Sonderstab Bildende Kunst or
              "Special Staff for Pictorial Art."</p>
            <p>The Database of Art Objects at the Jeu de Paume is a joint project of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims
              against Germany and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This database brings together for the first
              time in searchable illustrated form the remaining registration cards and photographs produced by the ERR covering
              more than 20,000 art objects taken from Jews in German-occupied France and, to a lesser extent, in Belgium.
              Searchable by individual objects and by the owners from whom these objects were taken, the database is a detailed
              record of a small but important part of the vast seizure of cultural property that was integral to the Holocaust.</p>

            <p>The Direzione Generale Archivi (DGA: Italian Directorate General of Archives) coordinates and promotes the activities
              of all of the Italian State Archives (one in each province) and of the Soprintendenze archivistiche (Archival
              Departments, one in each region). The State Archives hold the documents that all state offices deposit 40 years
              after the records were created. The records of the offices of the Prime Minister, the ministries and other
              central bodies are sent to the Central State Archives in Rome, and those from regional offices go to the appropriate
              State Archives in each province. The Soprintendenze supervise the archives of other public authorities and
              of private archives considered of notable historical importance. This means that the DGA does not directly
              conserve documents but supervises all the state, public and private archives throughout the country.</p>
            <p>The Royal Decree 126/1939 stated that Italian Jews could not own assets exceeding a certain amount. A special
              public agency, Ente di Gestione e Liquidazione Immobiliare (EGELI: Agency for Real Estate Management and Liquidation),
              was in charge of management and destination of excess assets. After January 1944, EGELI was in charge of the
              assets both seized and confiscated from Jews in the Fascist Italian Social Republic who had been sent to concentration
              camps. EGELI delegated the management of these assets to public and private credit institutions. Cultural properties
              were not mentioned separately, so it is necessary to search the files to find evidence of looted art and other
              cultural property. Please use the links below to view descriptions of relevant records included in the DGA

            <p>The Findbuch for Victims of National Socialism makes it possible to search the holdings of several Austrian archives
              for material on National Socialist property seizures and Austrian restitution and compensation measures. It is
              possible to call up information such as the &quot;property notices&quot; that Jewish people
              had to submit after the Anschluss of Austria in 1938 as well as the files of the Restitution Commissions that
              were established after the war. Due to data protection laws, registration is necessary in order to undertake
              research in the personal data holdings of the Findbuch. The Findbuch is purely a reference database and is
              therefore not a substitute for ordering the file from the relevant archive.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Findbuch provides in digital form <a href="https://www.findbuch.at/address-directories">historical address books and official handbooks on public offices and institutions that facilitate research on private individuals, companies or the authorities that were responsible for the National Socialist seizures of property or restitution post-1945</a>.</p>

            <p>The Art Database of the National Fund provides information on art and cultural objects presently located in museums
              and collections of the Republic of Austria or of the City of Vienna, which, according to latest provenance
              research, may have been seized under the National Socialist regime. Their publication in this database takes
              place in co-operation with the Federal museums and collections concerned and with other Austrian institutions
              conducting provenance research and aims to determine whether there is a possibility of restituting these objects.

            <p>Heidelberg University Library provides access to around 8,000 auction catalogues published between 1901 and 1945
              in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and additional countries occupied by Germany during this period.
            </p>
            <p>The auction catalogues were partly digitized within the framework of the project "German Sales 1930-1945. Art
              Works, Art Markets, and Cultural Policy". The Kunstbibliothek der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, as well as
              the Getty Research Institute, were partners in this project, which was generously supported by the Deutsche
              Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Volkswagen
              Stiftung. Further auction catalogues are being digitized as part of the ongoing project "Art - Auctions - Provenances.
              The German Art Trade as Reflected in Auction Catalogues from 1901 to 1929" a collaborative effort of Heidelberg
              University Library and the Kunstbibliothek der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin. It is financially supported by
              the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation).
            </p>
            <p>All of the digitized auction catalogues, which today are scattered over numerous art and museum libraries, are
              accessible free of charge on the <a href="http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/Englisch/Welcome.html">website of Heidelberg University Library</a>              as well as within the overall context of the project <a href="http://www.arthistoricum.net/en/subjects/thematic-portals/german-sales/">"German Sales 1901-1945" </a>on
              arthistoricum.net. In addition to the digital images, OCR processing has provided searchable full texts. Refined
              search functions including the full text search have improved the accessibility to material that previously
              has been difficult to access. The search options provide the possibility to browse the digital collection by
              countries, cities, auction houses or collectors.</p>

          <div id="general">
            <p>The Deutsches Kunstarchiv in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, is the largest archive of primary documentation
              relating to German art and culture. Its holdings cover the fine arts in German-speaking countries, with a focus
              on hand- and typewritten manuscripts as well as personal documents such as letters, and professional records
              of the careers of artists and art historians as well as art institutions and galleries. In addition to gathering
              and preserving artists' and art historians' estates in order to catalogue them and make them publicly available,
              the Deutsches Kunstarchiv is actively engaged in researching its own holdings as the basis for exhibitions,
              publications and lectures.</p>
            <p>The Galerie Heinemann Munich was founded in 1872 by David Heinemann (1819-1902) and was numbered amongst the
              most important art dealerships in Germany until its Aryanization in 1938. The gallery, which operated internationally,
              had several branch offices in cities such as Frankfurt am Main, Nice and New York. It specialized in 19th and
              early 20th century German art, but also dedicated itself to English, French and Spanish art. Altogether it
              organized approximately 300 solo and thematic group exhibitions between 1880 and 1935.</p>
            <p>The Galerie Heinemann project, comprising digitization, data entry and internet presentation of the gallery's
              documents, is the first major digitization project of German dealer records relevant to the Nazi era. The provision
              of dealer records online is a significant development in assisting researchers internationally in documenting
              provenance. The Galerie Heinemann project was developed by the Deutsches Kunstarchiv in cooperation with the
              Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte, Munich, as well as with the conceptual assistance of Facts &amp; Files,
              Historisches Forschungsinstitut Berlin (Historic Research Institute). The Arbeitsstelle für Provenienzrecherche/
              -forschung (Bureau for Provenance Research and Investigation), Berlin, approved and provided financial support
              for the project in spring 2009. The Galerie Heinemann internet database was activated on July 29, 2010.</p>

              as the catalogs and photographs, which are stored in the Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte, Munich. Searches
              are available for individual artworks and associated information, which includes data on artists, clients,
              purchases and sales. The database provides both a transcription of the most important content of the records,
              as well as scans of the original documents. The database facilitates a simple search within a full-text search
              mode as well as an advanced search with selected search fields.</p>
